## Instructions to run
We built and compiled these files using Java 1.8.0_181 and assume that you have Java installed on your machines as well

First you should download all the files in this folder of the repository onto a single folder on your machine

Then you should navigate to the folder containing all the downloaded files using your command prompt

For example, my files lie inside a folder called HW1 inside of my repository folder, so I would then use the following command to get into the correct directory

```
cd Documents\CSCI4448\CSCI-4448\HW1
```

Once inside the correct directory run the following command to compile the .class files

```
javac Program.java
```

To then execute the main program, run the command

```
java Program
```
